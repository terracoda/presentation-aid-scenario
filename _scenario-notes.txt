Actions:
1. Effectively present materials for the web
-clear introduction
-clear learning objectives
-clear actions or activities

2. Web Accessibility
-ensure that the html mark-up is optimized for accessibility.
-when changing the design and colors re-check for contrast ratios.
-when adding interactvity, consider fallbacks
-ensure all images have appropriate alternative text

3.Graphical Design Approach:
-clear presentation and organization of course content.
-organize the content so the key points are easily found by skimming. 
-clearly distinguish between what's content, what's an example and what's an activity.

-visual interest and little surprises can be used to engage the learner with the content.

3. Can this approach be used as a template or model for other modules?
-This particular approach is likely general enought to be applied to future modules. However, I really do not have enough to go on to determine if the design choices made here will be appropriate for the rest of the course.
-To make more solid design choices and to to be able to identify paterms in the content, I would need more than one module and preferably the syllabus.
-Without the syllabus it is difficult to determine the how important certain components are or what D2L tools will be used. Being familiar with the syllabus upfront allows me to align my web design choices with istructional design decisions and goals.
  

4. Course Technology
-Proper use of the D2L Content menu - Lon and Short headings
-Suggestion for an engaging activity - perhaps compose an email to a classmate and assess an email from a different classmate.
-Which D2L tool is best - course mail or discussion forum?
