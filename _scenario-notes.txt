Graphical Design Approach
Layout &amp; Design:
1. Effectively present materials in D2L and for the web
-clear presentation and organization of course content.
-organize the content so the key points are easily found by skimming. 
-clearly distinguish between what's content, what's an example and what's an activity.
-visual interest and little surprises can be used to engage the learner with the content.
-flexible/liquid layout for the web.

-introduction
-learning objectives
-activities: course notes
-on the pages: key points are easily found by skimming
-engagement through visual interest and little surprises can be used to engage the learner with the content.

2. Ask upfront for information
-textbook &amp; copyright
-what tools will be used for assessment - what icons an be used throughout the course to highlight certain activites, key content or due dates.
-more content would be needed to determine if this approach would work for more modules

3. Web Accessibility
-ensure that the html mark-up is optimized for accessibility.
-when changing the design and colors re-check for contrast ratios.
-ensure all images have appropriate alternative text
-when adding interactvity, consider fallbacks.

4. Consistency for Subsequent Modules
-Can this approach be used as a template or model for other modules?
-This particular approach is likely general enough to be applied to future modules.
However, I would prefer to have more information and more content to before putting too much effort into customization of layout and design.
-To make solid design decisions I need to be able to understand the goals and identify patterns. Ideally more than one module and preferably the syllabus.
-Being familiar with the syllabus and the content upfront allows me to align my web design choices with istructional design decisions.

5. Course Technology
-Proper use of the D2L Content menu - Long and Short headings
-Suggestion for an engaging activity - perhaps compose an email to a classmate and assess an email from a different classmate.
-Which D2L tool is best chice for this - course mail or discussion forum?
