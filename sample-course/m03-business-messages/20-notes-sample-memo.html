<h1>Sample Memorandum</h1>

<div class="rc green">
  <h2 class="textCenter">Memorandum</h2>
	<ul class="nobullet">
		<li><strong>Date:</strong> March 31, 2014</li>
		<li><strong>To:</strong> John Doe, COMM 300 Student</li> 
		<li><strong>From:</strong> Suzie Que, COMM 300 Instructor</li>  
    </ul>
	<h3 id="field-subject" class="field"><strong>Subject:</strong> Memo and E-mail Purpose, Organization &amp; Format</h3>
		
	<p id="field-opening" class="field">Here is some general information you requested about memo and e-mail purpose, organization and format.</p>
	
	<div id="field-body" class="field"> 
		<p>A <strong>memo</strong> is a type of workplace correspondence that is an <strong>internal</strong> document: it is meant for a reader or readers within the company. A memo is formatted using specific headings, as demonstrated in this memo. A focused "subject line" is very important. Paper memos, though still used at times, are being replaced by <strong>e-mail</strong>.</p>
		<p>An <strong>e-mail</strong> is a hybrid of letter and memo used for communication with readers inside <strong>(internal use)</strong> and outside the company <strong>(external use)</strong>. An e-mail&apos;s pre-formatted headings resemble those of memos&mdash;such as this one&mdash;while the body of the message is laid out more like a letter, with a salutation, body, and sign-off signature block.</p>
		<p>Both types of documentation are multi-functional and are written to:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>inform</li>
			<li>inquire</li>
			<li>request</li>
			<li>respond</li>
			<li>refuse, and</li>
			<li>report.</li>
		</ul>
		<p>Both memos and e-mails can be organized using the <strong>direct</strong> or <indirect>indirect</indirect> pattern of organization, depending on their purpose.</p>
		
		<p>A memo or e-mail, like all workplace documents&mdash;especially e-mails which is both an internal and external document. Your e-mails will represent both you, as writer and your company to a far-reaching audience. Proper netiquette is indispensable.</p> 	
	</div>
	<div id="field-closing" class="field">
		<p>Please see your textbook to learn more about the purposeful structuring of a memo or e-mail and refer back to the course content for information on <a href="10-notes-patterns.html">business e-mail etiquette</a> as well as a review of the <a href="30-notes-checklist.html">typical components of a memo</a>.</p>

<div class="hide">
<dl id="term-subject">
    <dt>Subject line:</dt>
	<dd>Summarize the central idea. Make sure the subject line reads like a newspaper heading&mdash;brief but clear. Use an abbreviated style. Omit articles (a, an, the), and do not try to make the subject line a complete sentence. Omit an ending period mark.</dd>
</dl>
<dl id="term-opening">	
	<dt>Opening:</dt>
	<dd>State the purpose for writing. Include the same information that's in the subject line, but expand it. Ask questions immediately. If you are requesting information, begin with the most important question to use a polite command (e.g. Please answer the following questions about&hellip;). Supply information directly. If responding to a request, give the reader the requested information immediately in the opening. Explain later, in the body of the memo/e-mail.</dd>
</dl>
<dl id="term-body">	
	<dt>Body:</dt>
	<dd>Explain details. Arrange information logically. For complex topics use separate paragraphs developed coherently. Enhance readability. Use short sentences, short paragraphs, and parallel construction for similar ideas. Supply graphic highlighting. Provide bulleted and/or numbered lists, tables or other graphic devices to improve readability and comprehension. Be cautious. Remember that memos and e-mail messages often travel far beyond their intended audiences.</dd>
</dl>
<dl id="term-closing">	
	<dt>Closing:</dt>
	<dd>Request action. If appropriate, state specifically what you want the reader to do. Include a deadline, with reasons, if possible. Summarize the memo or provide a closing thought. For long memos provide a summary of the important points. If neither an action nor a summary is necessary, end with a closing thought. Avoid <em lang="fr">clich&eacute;</em> endings. Use fresh remarks rather than overused expressions such as <q>If you have additional questions, please do not hesitate to call</q> or <q>Thank you for your cooperation</q>.</dd>
